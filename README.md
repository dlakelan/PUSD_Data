# PUSD_Data
Data sets and Information relevant to the Pasadena Unified School District

data_sources.txt is a description of various original sources and
their contents, include URLs and human readable description of the
contents.

For archives of related data, please create sub-directories. Like for
example CAASPP research datasets could go into a CAASPP
directory. Data from the Census could go into a directory specifically
for that Census product (like the ACS or similar).
